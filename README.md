# Theft-detection-using-Arduino-and-GSM

This project I have implemented using two ways one by using gsm and other by using a server.
The code named gsm_ldr is using gsm, in which we use gsm to send the message to a another mobile number
The code using_server is using a server, in which we use gsm to send the message to the server
